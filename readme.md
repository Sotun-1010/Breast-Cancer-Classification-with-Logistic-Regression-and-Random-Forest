## Overview

<!-- ![screenshot]() -->

In this project, I leveraged some machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. I got the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data) contains 30 features such as mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, etc. and whether the tumor is malignant or benign. I used logistic regression and random forest to classify the tumors and I evaluated the performance of the model. I also compared the performance of the two models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Overall this project was a compelling demonstration of how data science can contribute to critical fields like healthcare. My journey through data loading, cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation, capped off with detailed evaluation, showcases a comprehensive approach to building reliable predictive systems. The insights gained from comparing feature means highlighted the morphological differences between benign and malignant cells, reinforcing the biological relevance of my chosen features.
This project is a small but significant step in leveraging data to empower medical professionals with more accurate and efficient diagnostic tools, ultimately contributing to better patient care and outcomes. It's a truly rewarding feeling to know that my work in the data lab can make a tangible difference in the real world as I continue to work towards my future aspirations. Thanks for reading and stay lit.
